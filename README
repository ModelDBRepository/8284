Chen K, Aradi I, Thon N, Eghbal-Ahmadi M, Baram TZ, Soltesz I: Persistently modified
h-channels after complex febrile seizures convert the seizure-induced enhancement of
inhibition to hyperexcitability. Nature Medicine, 7(3) pp. 331-337, 2001.


Ccellsyn.hoc - CONTROL cell
HTcellsyn.hoc - HT cell

To simulate these cells, we need all of the following mechanisms:

ichan.mod - Na and K channel kinetics in HT and Control cells
hyperso.mod - HT and Control Ih channels in the soma
hyperde1.mod - HT and Control Ih channels in the proximal dendrites
hyperde2.mod - HT and Control Ih channels in the middle dendrites
hyperde3.mod - HT and Control Ih channels in the distal dendrites
ppsyn.mod - inducing synaptic currents in HT and Control cells
